# Perceiver Implementation in PyTorch

This is a PyTorch implementation of the **Perceiver** architecture, based on the original paper: [Perceiver: General Perception with Iterative Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03206).

- This code is partly based on [lucidrains' perceiver-pytorch implementation](https://github.com/lucidrains/perceiver-pytorch), with some shared code.
- The **Lamb optimizer** in the `include/` directory is borrowed from the implementation by [cybertronai](https://github.com/cybertronai/pytorch-lamb).
- The **Transformer** code in `include/transformer` is based on [attention-is-all-you-need-pytorch](https://github.com/jadore801120/attention-is-all-you-need-pytorch).
